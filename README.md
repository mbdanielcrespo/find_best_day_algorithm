## Overview

The main objective is to **find the best day** for public transport operations or usage based on specific parameters and data. The accompanying PDF ([AADS (3).pdf](AADS%20(3).pdf)) provides background information and the mathematical or theoretical basis behind the approach.

**Key Points:**
- Designed to analyze or simulate transport data to determine “best day” metrics.
- Provides a user-friendly GUI, making it simpler to change parameters, run simulations, or visualize results.
- Primarily written in **Python**.

## Features

- **Algorithmic Core**  
  A robust algorithm that processes transport data, aiming to optimize the selection of a best day based on the defined criteria.
- **Graphical User Interface**  
  Developed in Python to allow easy testing and manipulation of input data without digging directly into the code.
- **Customizable Parameters**  
  Data inputs and other factors can be adjusted to explore different scenarios.

**Description:**
This chart depicts a broad range of whimsical and real transport methods over time, labeled on the vertical axis. The red dashed line indicates a key date or threshold relevant to the algorithm.

**Description:**
This figure focuses on four major modes of transportation (Eurostar, Bus, Train, and Plane), plotted over several months. The red dashed line marks a transition point or target date.

**Description:**
Displays multiple transport modes, from planes to horse carriages, and indicates their active timelines. The vertical red line again serves as a critical reference date.
